This is a basic skeleton, designed as a starting point for building Silverstripe 4 Elemental modules.

This does not represent a working module, just the bare-bones.   Once you have created a new repo for your module using this template, you'll need to edit (as a minimum) the composer.json file to set a name, namespace, etc.

Code should be added in the `src`directory, following PSR autoloading guidelines for namespaces, directory structure, etc.

A simple structure for front-end assets has also been included, and these are exposed by composer.  Assets are included using the Requirements API in the template.  Paths here should be updated to match the actual module name.
